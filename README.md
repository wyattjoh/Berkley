####Sorting


This uses the quick sort algorithm to sort an associative struct of:

```
struct indexed
{
	uint32_t index;
	double value;
};
```

Using a custom sorting function as defined:

```
int Index::compare(const void * b, const void * a)
{
	indexed *struct_a = (indexed *) a;
	indexed *struct_b = (indexed *) b;
	
	if(struct_a->value < struct_b->value)
		return 1;
	else if(struct_a->value == struct_b->value)
		return 0;
	else
		return -1;
}
```

That performs the sorting on a value level, while preserving the indicies as they are carried with the value. This allows simple determination printing of the top 3 entries after the quicksort to display the smallest value for the distance calculation, carried out as:

```
double Index::compare(song *SongA, song *SongB)
{
	double result = 42;
	
	int matchingEntries = 0;
	
	int * A;
	int * B;
	
	if(SongA->rCount >= SongB->rCount)
	{
		A = new int[SongA->rCount];
		B = new int[SongA->rCount];
	}
	else
	{
		A = new int[SongB->rCount];
		B = new int[SongA->rCount];
	}
	
	for(int i = 0; i< SongA->rCount; i++)
	{
		for(int f = 0; f<SongB->rCount; f++)
		{
			
			if(SongA->ratings[i].User.compare(SongB->ratings[f].User) == 0)
			{
				A[matchingEntries] = SongA->ratings[i].rating;
				B[matchingEntries] = SongB->ratings[f].rating;
				
				matchingEntries++;
			}
		}
	}
	
	if( matchingEntries > 0 )
	{
		uint64_t sum = 0;
		
		for(int i = 0; i < matchingEntries; i++)
		{
			uint64_t temp = (A[i] - B[i]);
			sum += temp*temp;
		}
		
		result = sqrt(sum);
		
		result /= matchingEntries;
	}
	
	delete [] A;
	delete [] B;
	
	return result;
}
```

Which is designed to calculate the distance on two songs given a song struct, as defined:

```
struct rating {
	std::string User;
	uint8_t rating;
};

struct song {
	int id;
	std::string Title;
	std::string Artists;
	rating ratings[255];
	int rCount;
};
```

Through the use of the suggested distance formula:

```
 D(A, B) = SQRT( (R1A - R1B)^2 + (R2A - R2B)^2 + â€¦ (R2A - R2B)^2 )/N
```

###Indexing/Serilizing Data

Once the main entries of the input data file are filed into the main database file as:

```
Key: SONG ID
Data: SONG STRING

Ex.

For entry: {[5], [When I approach], [Travie McCoy Feat, Livin, Joe Budden], [(Ethan, 6), (Michael, 4), (Mason, 5)] }

Key: 5
Data: {[5], [When I approach], [Travie McCoy Feat, Livin, Joe Budden], [(Ethan, 6), (Michael, 4), (Mason, 5)] }
```

Where the string is parsed when needed. The indexed database, calculated after, is stored as:

```
Key: USER NAME
Data: SONG ID CSV

Ex.

For entrys:
{[4], [I Wanna Be A Billionaire], [Travie McCoy Feat, Bruno Mars], [(Michael, 6), (Mason, 2), (Sophia, 1)] }
{[5], [When I approach], [Travie McCoy Feat, Livin, Joe Budden], [(Ethan, 6), (Michael, 4), (Mason, 5)] }

We would store:

Key: Michael
Data: 4, 5,

Key: Mason
Data: 4, 5,

Key: Sophia
Data: 4

Key: Ethan
Data: 5
```

This would allow a list to be generated using each of the users whe have rated a given song to be directly pulled from the database rather then linearly scanning the database via the inverted indexed database.
